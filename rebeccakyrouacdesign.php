                    <p>In need of a website to showcase her visually eclectic and stunning work, Miami-based interior designer and metals artist Rebecca Kyrouac approached EGGFOO, cautiously. We responded in kind, slowly encircling her until a defensible position was attained. A brief stalemate ensued, broken by an unexpected bout of levity which led, ultimately, to an agreement to create a fully responsive website for Rebecca's work. In addition to the design and development of the site, a last-minute back-room deal added most of the site's photography to our list of responsibilities.</p><br />
