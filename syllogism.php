                    <p>What started out as an interactive Flash site for this London-based consultancy morphed into a site built with HTML/CSS/JS in order to meet Britain's more demanding accessibility requirements. In the end, we were able to meet Level AA of the W3C's Accessibility Guidelines while still managing to create a site that feels responsive. Sadly, some hair was lost in the process.</p><br />
